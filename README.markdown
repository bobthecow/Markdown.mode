Markdown.mode
=============

A Markdown syntax mode file for [Coda](http://panic.com/coda) (and possibly [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit)) written by [bobthecow](http://github.com/bobthecow).



Installation
------------

Drop `Markdown.mode` into `~Library/Application Support/Coda 2/Modes` (or `.../Coda/Modes`
if you're not using Coda 2). If that folder doesn't exist, create it.



Usage
-----

 1. Install.

 2. Open a file with a `.md`, `.mdown` or `.markdown` extension in Coda.

 3. ?

 4. Profit!



Known Issues
------------

Bold and Italics only work inline. This is not ideal, but the other option is currently leaking styles unpredictably invading the rest of the file.
